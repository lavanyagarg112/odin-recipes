    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p>Let's embark on a culinary journey to craft the perfect batch of potato wedges. They are like the robust cousins of French 
        fries - thicker, heartier, and with a satisfying bite. These wedges are usually baked or fried to achieve a crispy exterior 
        and a soft, fluffy interior, perfect for dipping or as a side dish.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        
        <li>Potatoes (about 4 large) - cut into wedges</li>
        <li>Olive oil - 3 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Paprika - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Garlic powder - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Onion powder - 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Salt - to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper - to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley (optional, for garnish) - chopped</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Preheat Oven: Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        <li>Prepare Potatoes: Wash the potatoes thoroughly and cut them into wedge shapes. You can peel them if you prefer, 
            but keeping the skin on adds a lovely texture and additional nutrients.</li>
        <li>Seasoning Mix: In a large bowl, mix together olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black 
            pepper.</li>
        <li>Seasoning Mix: In a large bowl, mix together olive oil, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black 
            pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake: Arrange the wedges on a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake in the preheated oven for about 35-40 minutes, 
            or until they are golden and crispy. Flip them halfway through the cooking time for even browning.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Once done, sprinkle with fresh parsley for an added pop of color and freshness. Serve hot with 
            your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
        

    </ol>
