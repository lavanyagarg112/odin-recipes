    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Spring roll wrappers</li>
        <li>Firm tofu, drained and crumbled</li>
        <li>Shredded cabbage</li>
        <li>Finely chopped carrots</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>Chopped onions</li>
        <li>Minced garlic</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Egg or water (for sealing the wrappers)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><b>Prepare the Tofu:</b> Press the tofu to remove excess water, then crumble it into small pieces.</li>
        <li><b>Sauté the Vegetables and Tofu:</b> In a pan, heat a little oil and sauté onions and garlic until fragrant. 
            Add the crumbled tofu, carrots, mushrooms, and cabbage. Stir-fry until the vegetables are tender but still crisp.</li>
        <li><b>Season the Filling:</b> Add soy sauce and sesame oil to the vegetable mixture. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let the 
            filling cool down before assembling.</li>
        <li><b>Wrap the Spring Rolls:</b> Place a wrapper on a flat surface, add a spoonful of the filling to the center, fold in the sides, then 
            roll tightly. Use a little water or beaten egg to seal the end.</li>
        <li><b>Fry the Spring Rolls:</b> Heat vegetable oil in a deep frying pan. Fry the spring rolls in batches until they're golden brown and 
            crispy. Don't overcrowd the pan to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li><b>Drain Excess Oil:</b> Once fried, transfer the spring rolls to a plate lined with paper towels to soak up any excess oil.</li>
        <li><b>Serve:</b> Enjoy the spring rolls hot with your choice of dipping sauce, such as sweet and sour sauce or a homemade dipping sauce
            made with soy sauce, rice vinegar, and a touch of chili oil for some heat.</li>
    </ol>
