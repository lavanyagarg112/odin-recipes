    <h3 class="subheading">Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 package (8 oz) cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped green onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts</li>
        <li>Crackers or sliced vegetables, for serving</li>

    </ul>

    <h3 class="subheading">Steps</h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Combine Cheeses: In a large bowl, mix together the shredded cheddar cheese and softened cream cheese until 
            well combined.</li>
        <li>Add Flavorings: Stir in the green onion, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and paprika. Mix until all ingredients are 
            evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Form the Ball: Once mixed, shape the cheese mixture into a ball using your hands. If the mixture is too soft, refrigerate it for about 30 minutes to 
            firm up a bit.</li>
        <li>Coat with Nuts: Roll the cheese ball in the chopped nuts until it is completely coated.</li>
        <li>Chill: Wrap the cheese ball in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least an hour before serving. This allows the 
            flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Serve: Serve your cheese ball with a selection of crackers and sliced vegetables like carrots, cucumbers, and 
            bell peppers.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! Break out the crackers and dive into this cheesy delight!</li>
