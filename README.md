My first website!

I learnt the basics of html as well as deploying a website from github through this project.

More specifically, I learnt the following:
- HTML boilerplate
- different font sizes (h1, h2.. p)
- different formatting tags like bold, strong, italics and emphasize
- Images
- Links
- Ordered and unordered lists

I look forward to learning more!
